This is the repository I am creating with the designs for the COVID epidemic developed in our group
There are three different designs we created: two respirator conectors alreadt tested and that worked well and a piece of the mecanism for a medical bed. The conectores were printed using a DLP-SLA printer with a biocompatible resine. The medical piece was usinated in aluminum.
